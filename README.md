<h1>Flight Planner Project</h1>

<p> Flight Planner started as a class exercise which tested student's ability to
write working code with the guidance of the pre-written tests.</p>
<h3> Program gives user-friendly output</h3>
<p> Run flight_checker.rb to see a hypothetical instance of flights for the day.</p>
<p> Assume there will be multiple flights leaving the starting destinations. </p>
<p> The code tests for pre-entered requests, such as starting from Miami to land in LA, assuming the program is given start and destination requests elsewhere as opposed to passing those arguments in the command line. </p>
<p> The code presents a user-friendly output that informs of direct flights, where to find connecting flights, and if there is no possible route. </p>
<p> Future hopes for this program would be to allow for flight times, and allow users to enter in their own route requests, use API/web scraping to get real flight information.</p>
