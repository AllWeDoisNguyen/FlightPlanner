<h1>Flight Planner Project</h1>

<p> Flight Planner started as a class exercise which tested student's ability to
write working code with the guidance of the pre-written tests.</p>
<p> I challenged myself to make the code actually do what a user would like to see.</p>
<p> Run flight_checker.rb to see a hypothetical instance of flights for the day.</p>
<p> Assume there will be multiple flights leaving the starting destinations. </p>
<p> The code tests for pre-entered requests, such as starting from Miami to land in LA. </p>
<p> The code presents a user-friendly output that informs of direct flights, where to find connecting flights, and if there is no possible route. </p>
<p> Future hopes for this program would be to allow for flight times, and allow users to enter in their own route requests</p>
